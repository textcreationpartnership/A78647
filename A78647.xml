            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Noble Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my laÅ¿t to you, I Å¿ignified to you, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which were like to befall us by the releeving of <hi>Droheda,</hi> but God by his infinite mercy hath freed us (I may Å¿ay miraculouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) from that hazard: for when our men there were driven to that extremitie to eat horÅ¿e-fleÅ¿h, Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> Å¿allied out of the Town with onely fortie Musketiers, and fortie HorÅ¿e, and beat off foure hundred of the Enemies, killed above threeÅ¿core of them, recovered fourÅ¿core Cowes and Oxen, and two hundred Å¿heep; burned foure Towns, and brought home two of their Colours. BeÅ¿ides, I muÅ¿t relate unto you Gods abundant goodneÅ¿Å¿e unto us, in that the night before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and Å¿uccours which we Å¿ent by Sea from <hi>Dublin</hi> to them, Å¿hould have entred into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111580:4"/>of <hi>Droheda,</hi> (which was Å¿trongly fenced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a Chain and Å¿everall boates) there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a Å¿torme which broke their chaines, and gave our men Å¿o free a paÅ¿Å¿age, as with little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie they came Å¿afely to the Town. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels were gathered at <hi>KilÅ¿halgham</hi> within Å¿even miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> above two thouÅ¿and men, where they were Å¿etled in a verie Å¿trongwood. My Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> carried out part of our Armie, and beat them out of that great Å¿trength (for they would not come into the Champaine) and killed above a hundred of them, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderable loÅ¿Å¿e of our Å¿ide, onely Captain <hi>James Rochfort,</hi> a moÅ¿t gallant and couragious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This was an act of great braverie, wherein Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> did, (as he doth alwayes) beyond expectation, expoÅ¿ing his perÅ¿on to as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as any man living could; and in truth he is a gallant man, full of courage and good affections, and deÅ¿erves great incouragement from that Å¿ide. Our Souldiers are in great want of money, which cauÅ¿es a generall want of all other neceÅ¿Å¿aries, yet notwithÅ¿tanding God hath infuÅ¿ed Å¿uch courage into them (for undoubtedly it is his work) that they think there is no danger Å¿o great, but they may attempt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:111580:4"/>Colonell <hi>Munke</hi> is arrived here with my Lord Lieutenants Regiment of fifteen hundred foot, and Sir <hi>Richard Grevill</hi> with neer foure hundred HorÅ¿e, which puts much heart into us, and makes us look big upon our neighbours, yet we grieve we cannot be able to releeve our friends in other parts; but I hope when our full Å¿uccours Å¿hall come, we Å¿hall not onely defend this place, but adde comfort to our poore diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>The enemy though their numbers be verie great, even beyond beleef, yet their hearts begin to faint, and I beleeve they repent their furious madneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
